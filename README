TODOS:
* Fix is_checkmate function if both sides have check
* Add to move piece function so you cant make a move that will put your king in check
* Make checks for board constructors arguments only two of each piece except pawns etc.
* Finish unit tests for board class
* Write tests for piece class
* Write tests for move class

NICE-TO-HAVE:
* Change board.legal_moves to a list instead of vector (no random accessing,
  just inserting and deleting), black/white_pieces too?
* Add enums/typedef instead of char and ints for some variables (move.piece, board.next_move,
	piece.symbol, piece.color etc.)

MAYBE-ADD:
* Replace switch in parse_legal_moves with polymorphic piece class instead
* Add member variable for king position for board (so you dont need to search
	piece vector for king each time you want to know if it is check)
