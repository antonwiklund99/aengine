TODOS:
* Change board.legal_moves to a list instead of vector (no random accessing,
  just inserting and deleting), black/white_pieces too??
* Fix is_checkmate function if both sides have check
* Replace switch in parse_legal_moves with polymorphic piece class instead??
* Add member variable for king position for board?? (so you dont need to search
	piece vector for king each time you want to know if it is check)
* Add function to move class to get move in notation format (same as string constructor)
