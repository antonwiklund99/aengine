TODOS:
* Make checks for board constructors arguments only two of each piece except pawns etc.
* Add ability to castle
* Add en passant
* Add pawn promotion
* Add all stalemate/loss conditions

REFACTORING:
* Change board.legal_moves to a list instead of vector (no random accessing,
  just inserting and deleting), black/white_pieces too?
* Add enums/typedef instead of char and ints for some variables (move.piece, board.next_move,
	piece.symbol, piece.color etc.)
* Change variable and function names to thisName from this_name
* Make parse_legal_moves do what clean_checked_moves does or find some cleaner way to remove
	moves that will put side in check

MAYBE-ADD:
* Replace switch in parse_legal_moves with polymorphic piece class instead
* Add member variable for king position for board (so you dont need to search
	piece vector for king each time you want to know if it is check)
