TODOS:
* Change board.legal_moves to a list instead of vector (no random accessing,
  just inserting and deleting), black/white_pieces too??
* Fix is_checkmate function if both sides have check
* Replace switch in parse_legal_moves with polymorphic piece class instead??
* Add member variable for king position for board?? (so you dont need to search
	piece vector for king each time you want to know if it is check)
* Add to move piece function so you cant make a move that will put your king in check
* Add enums/typedef instead of char and ints for some variables (move.piece, board.next_move,
	piece.symbol, piece.color etc.)
* Bug where pawn cant capture other pawn if it hasnt moved
* Bug a3-a4
			a3xx4 // Capture its own piece?
			b2-b3
* Start writing tests
